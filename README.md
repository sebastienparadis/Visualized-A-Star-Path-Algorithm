# Visualized A* Path-Finding Algorithm

This visualization of the A* Path-Finding ALgorithm invites users to set a start point and an end point, then draw any configuration of obstacles they want. The user can modify the dimensions, # of rows and columns, and create complex mazes or puzzles. Regardless, the A* Path Finding Algorithm will search the grid, finding the shortest path from start to end.
